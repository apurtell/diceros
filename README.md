project-diceros
===============

Diceros is a sub-project of Rhino project which focus on providing a hardware accelerated JCE provider. Initial effort include:
* AES-NI enabled AES/CTR/NOPADDING encryption/decryption support
* Hardware based true random generator (DRNG)

Diceros is not a full featured JCE provider yet for now, but we will make continuous effort towards that goal.
